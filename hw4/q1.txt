1. State the following optimization problems as decision problems:
• Vertex Cover
• Independent Set
• Knapsack
• Longest Increasing Subsequence
• Coin Row 

Vertex Cover 
Input: A graph G = (V, E) and a threshold value x 
Goal: Find a vertex cover with size less than or eqaul to x 


Independent Set 
Input: A graph G = (V, E), and a value g
Goal: Find an Independent Set with size greater than or eqaul to g 


Knapsack: 
Input: A list of N items, each with weight w1, w2...wn with values v1, v2...vn respectively 
       a maximum weight W, and a threshold V   
Goal: Find a subset of items such that the summation of the individual weight in the subset 
        is less than or equal to W, and the summation of the individual value is greater than or 
        eqaul to V 


Longest Increasing Subsequence: 
Input: A list of numbers a1, a1...an, and a threshold value g
Goal: Find an increasing subsequence of length greater than or equal to g 

Coin Row: 
Input: A list of n coins, c1, c2...cn whose values are some positive integers v1, v2...vn 
       and a value x 
Goal: Find a subset of coins with total value greater than or eqaul to x subject to the 
      constraint that no two consecutive coins can be selected in the original input list
