7. In the Subgraph Isomorphism problem we are given as input two undirected graphs G and H, we
wish to determine whether G is a subgraph of H (that is, whether by deleting certain vertices and
edges of H we obtain a graph that is, up to renaming of vertices, identical to G), and if so, return the
corresponding mapping of V (G) into V (H).
Prove that Subgraph Isomorphism is NP-complete. (Hint: Use Clique)
