2. Fill in the reduction diagram explicitly for the following reductions. You should include what a specific
instance and solution looks like for each problem in the reduction.
• Vertex Cover → Independent Set
• Clique → Independent Set
• 3SAT → Stingy SAT (see problem 6)
• Vertex Cover → Set Cover (see problem 8)
• Clique → Subgraph Isomorphism (see problem 7)
