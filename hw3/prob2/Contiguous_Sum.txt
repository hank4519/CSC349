2. A contiguous subsequence of a list S is a subsequence made up of consecutive elements of S. For in-
stance, if S = {5,15,−30,10,−5,40,10} then {15,−30,10} is a contiguous subsequence but {5,15,40}
is not. Give a dynamic programming algorithm for the following task: You are given a list of numbers,
{a1,a2,...,an}. You should return the contiguous subsequence of maximum sum (a subsequence of
length zero has sum zero). For the preceding example, the answer would be 10,−5,40,10, with a sum
of 55.


Definition: 
CS[i] = The sum of the contiguous subset of max sum from a1 -> ai including ai

Base Case(s): 
CS[0] = 0, CS[1] = a1

Solution: 
Max{ CS[i] }

Formula: 
CS[i] = Max { ai , CS[i - 1] + ai }





Definition: Let CS[i] be the maximum value of the contiguous subset from elements 
            a1 through ai including ai

Base Case: CS[0] = 0, CS[1] = a1 

Solution: Max {CS[i]} 

Formula: CS[i] = Max{ai, CS[i-1] + ai}


example: 5, 15, -30, 10, -5, 40, 10 

CS[i]:   5, 20, -10, 10,  5, 45, 55
