6. When a new gene is discovered, a standard approach to understanding its function is to look through a
database of known genes and find close matches. The closeness of two genes is measured by the extent
to which they are aligned. To formalize this, think of a gene as being a long string over an alphabet
Σ = {A,C,G,T}. Consider two genes (strings) x = ATGCC and y = TACGCA. An alignment of x
and y is a way of matching up these two strings by writing them in columns, for instance:
- A T - G C C
T A - C G C A
Here the “-” indicates a “gap”. The characters of each string must appear in order, and each column
must contain a character from at least one of the strings. The score of an alignment is specified by
a scoring matrix δ of size (|Σ|+ 1) ×(|Σ|+ 1), where the extra row and column are to accommodate
gaps. For instance the preceding alignment has the following score: δ(−,T) + δ(A,A) + δ(T,−) +
δ(−,C),+δ(G,G) + δ(C,C) + δ(C,A)



Definition: 
The max scoring alignment of the two strings x1 to xi and y1 to yj given the scoring matrix S

Base Case(s): 
G[i, 0] = S(i, -)
G[0,j] = S(-, j)

Solution: 
G[n, m]

Formula: 
		G[i,j] = Max 
    {
      G[i, j-1] + S(i, -)
      G[i-1, j] + S(-, j)
      G[i-1, j-1] + S(i,j)
    }





Definition: G[i, j] = the maximum value of the alignment between two genes' sequence i and 
                        j using levenshtein distance
Base Case: G[i, 0] = 0
           G[0, j] = 0 
Solution: G[x, y] 
Formula: G[i, j] = Max{ 
            G[i, j - 1] 
            G[i - 1, j] 
            G[i - 1, j - 1] + δ(i, j)
        }

Example: 
    δ table: 
        A C G T - 
    A   4 1 2 1 0
    C   1 4 1 2 0
    G   2 1 4 1 0
    T   1 2 1 4 0 
    -   0 0 0 0 0

      0 A T A G C C 
      0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
    T 0 1 4 4 4 4 4 
    G 0 2 4 6 8 8 8 
    C 0 2 4 6 8 12 12 
    T 0 2 6 6 8 12 14
    G 0 2 6 8 10 12 14
