4. Firestones is considering opening a series of restaurants along Highway 1. The n possible locations are
along the highway, and the distances of these locations from the downtown San Luis Obispo are, in
miles and in increasing order, m1,m2,...,mn. The constraints are:
• At each location, Firestones may open at most one restaurant. The expected profit from opening
a restaurant at location i is pi, where pi > 0 and i = 1,2,...,n.
• Any two restaurants must be at least k miles apart, where k is a positive integer.
Give a dynamic programming algorithm to compute the maximum expected total profit subject to the
given constraint s.



Definition: 
F[i] = The value of the max profit Firestone’s can make subject to the constraints, 
drawing from profits p1 to pi, including pi

Base Case(s): 
F[0] = 0, F[1] = p1

Solution: 
Max { F[i] }

Formula: 
F[i] = Max { F[j] + pi }  s.t. mj <= mi - k







Definition: Let F[i] = the maximum profit achivable from opening franchises of Firestones
            drawing from location 0 through i including i under the condition that only one 
            restaurant is allowed at each location i and two restaurants have to be k miles 
            apart from each other.

Base Case: F[0] = 0 

Solution: F[n] 

Formula: Max {pi + F[c]}
            0 < i <= n, 
            c are previous restaurants that were at least k miles apart: m[i] - m[c] >= k



Example: 

let's say k = 20
m1, m2, m3, m4 = 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70 respectively
p1, p2, p3, p4 = 8,  7,  3,  2,  4,  10, 1

m:         10  20  30  40   50  60  70
p:         8   7   3   2   4    10  1
F[i]:      8   7   11  9   15   21  16
Max Profit: 21


Another example: 
k = 20 
m = 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 30, 33 
p = 50, 1,  2,   3,  4,  5, 60, 78 
F:  50, 1,  2,   3,  4,  5, 110, 128
Max Profit: 128
