4. Firestones is considering opening a series of restaurants along Highway 1. The n possible locations are
along the highway, and the distances of these locations from the downtown San Luis Obispo are, in
miles and in increasing order, m1,m2,...,mn. The constraints are:
• At each location, Firestones may open at most one restaurant. The expected profit from opening
a restaurant at location i is pi, where pi > 0 and i = 1,2,...,n.
• Any two restaurants must be at least k miles apart, where k is a positive integer.
Give a dynamic programming algorithm to compute the maximum expected total profit subject to the
given constraint s.


Definition: Let F[i] = the maximum profit of opening franchises of Firestones drawing from location 0 through
            i including i under the condition that only one restaurant is allowed at each location i and two 
            restaurants have to be k miles apart from each other 

Base Case: F[0] = 0 

Solution: F[n] 

Formula: F[n] = Max (P[i] + F[c]), where 0 <= i <= n, 
                                   and c is the last location that's at least k miles away from i 




Example: 

let's say k = 20
m1, m2, m3, m4 = 10, 20, 30, 40 respectively
p1, p2, p3, p4 = 5, 7, 3, 2 

m:      0   10  20  30  40 
p:      0   5   7   3   2 
F[i]:   0   5   7   8   9
Max Profit: 9 


Another example: 
k = 20 
m = 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 30, 33 
p = 50, 1,  2,   3,  4,  5, 60, 78 
F:  50, 1,  2,   3,  4,  5, 110, 80
Max Profit: 110 

Logistics: 
 
For each F[i], we look for the last location c that is at least k miles away
F[i] = p[i] + F[c] 

If such location c does not exists
F[i] = p[i]
