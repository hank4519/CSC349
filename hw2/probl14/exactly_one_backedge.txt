True or False? (Proof or counterexample) If a directed graph G = (V, E) is cyclic but can be made
acyclic by removing one edge, then a depth-first search in G will encounter exactly one back edge.

True 

Suppose a direct graph G = (V,E) is cyclic and can be made acyclic by removing one edge, and a dfs encounter 
more then one back edges 

If we remove any edges other than back edges, the graph will still be cyclic
If we remove one back edge, since we have more than one back edges, there will be at leaset one back edge
    left in the graph 

If there is a back edge, the graph will be cyclic, which contradicts to the hypothesis that the graph will become
acyclic 

Thus, a depth-first search in G will encounter exactly one back edge
