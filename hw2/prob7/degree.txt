To Prove: summation of degree (u), where u belongs to graph G, is equal to 2|E| 

Proof: 
    let E be the number of edges in grpah G 
    each edge connects two vertices, which generates 1 degree for each vertex
    Thus, one edge gives exactly 2 degrees in an undirected graph, nothing more nothing less
    Thus, summation of degrees = 2|E| 

Since the sum of the degrees is even and the sum of the degrees of vertices with even degree is even, the sum of the degrees of vertices with odd degree must be even. If the sum of the degrees of vertices with odd degree is even, there must be an even number of those vertices.





Prove: summation of degree(u) is 2|E|

Proof by Contradiction: 
    if we have summation of degree != 2|E| 
    one node with a n edges, must have n + 1 or n - 1 degree 
    but each edge is shared by two nodes and it's undirected, 
    each node's degree will be exactly eqaul to the number of edges which is n, 
    and that contradicts to the condition of having n + 1 or n - 1 degree

Thus, summation of degree(u) for undirected graph is 2|E| 

even number of vertices with odd degree is not necessarily true, consider a cycle with three nodes 
each node has a degree of 2, but it doesn'r have an even number of vertices with odd degree

Summation of degree(u) is 2|E| does not hold true for directed graph because indegree/outdegree != degree
