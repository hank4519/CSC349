Is it always possible to make an undirected graph with two connected components connected by adding
a single edge?
• Why or why not? (Proof or counterexample)
• Does the same hold true for directed graphs (and strongly connected components rather than
connected components)? (Proof or counterexample)

connected components -> for each u, v, there exists a path in G from u to v 

Direct Proof: 
    connected components mean that for each u, v, there exists a path from u to v 
    suppose component one has v1, v2... vn 
    component two has m1, m2... mn 
    if any vertex in component one v is connected to any vertex in component two m, 
    any vertex in component 2 is reachable from v since they're reachable from m and v is connected to m
    thus, we can make an undirected graph out of it 


It does not hold true for directed graph because the added edge is also directed, 
it guarenteed u can reach any vertex in in component 2 
but it doesn't guarentee that a vertex in component 2 can reach any vertex in component 1
