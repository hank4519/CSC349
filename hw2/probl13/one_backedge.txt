cyclic ->  one back edge -> remove an edge -> acyclic

Proof by counter Example 

Suppose a directed graph G(v,e), and DFS gives exactly one
back edge, and by removing an edge, we will still have a cyclic
graph

further suppose the edge we are removing is the only back edge,
it left us with a directed grpah with no back edges. And without
backedges, the graph traversal is one directional and no cycles
possible. Which is a contradiction to the hypothesis that we
will still have a cyclic graph. 

Thus,  then it is possible to choose an edge e ∈ E such that the graph
without e (G′ = (V, E \{e})) is acyclic.
