Give an example of a strongly connected directed graph G = (V, E) such that, for every v âˆˆ V ,
removing v from G leaves a directed graph that is not strongly connected.

Suppose a strongly connected graph with vertices v1, v2, ... vn
It is strongly connected so each vertex is reachable from any other vertex 
And this is only possible if this component is composed of several small cycles or a big cycle 

Either way, if we remove any element from the graph, let's say a small cycle a1 -> a2 -> a3 -> a1
This cycle will be disconnected, and it will be impossible for vertex in this cycle to reach other vertices
in the graph 

We can do proof by contradiction on this 

Thus, if v is removed from G, it leaves a directed graph that is not strongly connected
