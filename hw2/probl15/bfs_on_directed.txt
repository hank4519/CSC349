BFS(G, v) 

Input: A directed graph G = (V,E), and a vertex v 
Output: for all vertices, dist(X) is set to be the distance from v to X  

for all X in V do 
    dist(X) = infinity 
dist(v) = 0 
Q = [v] (a queue containing v) 
while Q is not empty do 
    x = dequeue(Q) 
    for all outgoing neighbors of x, u do 
        if dist(u) == infinity do 
            dist(u) = dist(x) + 1 
            enqueue(u) 


Algorithm Runtime: 
O(n + m)
where n is the number of vertices 
and m is the number of edges
