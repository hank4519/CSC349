Prove the following theorem:
In any connected undirected graph, there is a vertex whose removal leaves the graph connected.


Suppose we have a connected undirected graph with n vertices. 
If we perform a traversal on any vertex, it will give at least one leaf node. 
And remove the leaf node does not affect the connectivity of other parts of the graph. 
Thus, in any connected undirected graph, there is a vertex whose removal leaves the graph still connected. 



In any connected undirected graph, there is a vertex whose removal leaves the graph connected.

If we run depth first search, we will have a spanning tree, and remove the leaf of the tree will leave the 
graph connected.
